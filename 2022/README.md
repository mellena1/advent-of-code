My solutions for Advent of Code 2022. Started originally so I could learn Kotlin.

### Running Kotlin Answers
I'm not using a build system (i.e. gradle or maven), so you have to manually compile and build each file.

From the directory of the day you want to run:
```sh
kotlinc main.kt && kotlin MainKt.class
```
